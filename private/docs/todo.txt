problem : 
	Do I need to hard code the CRUD operation for the Model definitions or I can use the existing
generic logic to perform the CRUD.

Sol:

	- in generic CURD check the model name, if it is 'model' then use ModelDefDb else subscribe
		the model.
		
	- publish the model def where it is created. ie in model_db.js

*********************************************************************************

problem: during creation of model definitions.


*********************************************************************************

problem : import csv

	case 1: import model definitions
		case 1: Model definition is not already exist
		sol: 
			1: insert model definition in modeldb
			2: publish model on server
			3: subscribe model from client
			4: 
		case 2: Model definition already exsist
	case 2: import model instance data
		constraint: model definition must exist before importing model instance data
